**MinisVS** is an extension for visual scripting in Unity that adds custom
units for handling MIDI input.

It uses [Minis] as a backend. If you're interested in using MIDI without visual
scripting, check the [Minis] project.

### MIDI Note unit

**MIDI Note** is a unit for handling MIDI note input. You can specify a MIDI
channel and a MIDI note number to which the unit listens.

You can use the *Note On/Off* ports to hook up a flow to MIDI note events.

The *Is-Pressed* port outputs true while the specified note is on.

The *Velocity* port outputs the velocity value on the last note.

### MIDI Control unit

**MIDI Control** is a unit for handling MIDI control input (CC). You can specify
a MIDI channel and a MIDI control number to which the unit listens.

You can use the *Changed* port to hook up a flow to MIDI control-change events.

The *Value* port outputs the current value of the control element.
